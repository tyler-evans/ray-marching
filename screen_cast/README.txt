Four videos are provided to show the intended behaviour of the three files

in the event that something goes wrong and they do not display correctly
in the browser.  

A link to a sharable google drive folder is provided.



intermediateSteps.mov: A recording of the process outlined in section 3 to 
strip down the process and help visualize what is going on.



GUIshowcase.mov: Brief exploration of the GUI features.



multipleObjects: Showing the scene where we have multiple objects.



clawMachine.mov: Showing the scene in which we have multiple ray marched
objects alongside the clawmachine.



Note that the frame-rate of the videos is pretty horrible, they were recorded 
on my laptop while also having to run the scenes themselves.
